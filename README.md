# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim

To present one UX project scenario and perform problem identification, research method selection, and persona creation.


## Algorithm

### 1. Identifying and Writing Problem Statements

- Identify user pain points.  
- Write 1–2 problem statements using the format:  
  **"[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."**

### 2. Identifying Appropriate Research Methods

- Select the most suitable UX research methods.  
- Justify why each method is appropriate.

### 3. Creating Personas

Create at least two personas with:

- Demographics  
- Goals  
- Behaviors  
- Pain points  
- Motivations

### Scenario: Digital Health Service Portal

The project focuses on improving a digital health portal where users can book appointments, refill medicines, view schemes, and access medical records.


### 1. Identifying and Writing Problem Statements

#### User Pain Points

- Users have difficulty locating key services like appointments, refills, and medical records.  
- The status of health requests is unclear or easy to miss.  
- First-time users feel overwhelmed by too many options on the dashboard.  

#### Problem Statements

**Problem Statement 1**  
“Patients need a way to quickly find the correct health service because the dashboard has multiple sections that look similar, which results in confusion and delays.”

**Problem Statement 2**  
“Users need a way to clearly understand the status of their health requests because updates are not easily noticeable, which results in missed appointments or delayed medication refills.”


### 2. Identifying Appropriate Research Methods

#### Selected Methods

1. **Usability Testing**  
   To observe how users navigate the health portal and identify where they get stuck while accessing appointments, refills, or medical records.

2. **User Interviews**  
   To understand what information users expect on the home page and what confuses them during real tasks.

3. **Surveys**  
   To collect data from a large group to understand which services users access most and what improvements they expect.

#### Justification

A combination of usability testing, interviews, and surveys helps capture both **user behavior** (how they navigate) and **user expectations** (what they want), making it suitable for a diverse audience of patients.
